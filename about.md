Loving father of two sons, loving husband, golfer by heart and a software developer with more than 20 years of coding experience from low-level Win32 API development, 
network & security applications to early adaptor of Microsoft .NET technologies. Worked on ASP.NET for 10 years and had sole peacher
of .NET technologies since.

However, recently moved out and concentrating on open-source software and working with `Java`, `Python`, `Golang`, `bash` etc. Also
highly concentrating on **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)** to develop large scale enterprise content managed web applications.

I'm aiming to write whatever I come across and document it, not probably the finiest way but as much as readable. This wouldn't just 
help me in the future for reference also for people facing the same trouble.
